From the time I was born at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, to my current jogs up and down the streets, paths, and dusty roads of the city. My love for the \"Purple City\" has never wavered. My Grandparents handed down this love of Pasco, because from the time they settled in Pasco in the early 1950's, they saw what we all see today. A community that embraces diversity, change, and most importantly, growth. \n\nThe past 30 years Pasco's growth wasn't always handled with a long term and innovative thought process. Pasco is doing a much better job now. But some residents of Pasco seem left out and wanting more. I hope to bring a voice of the everyday residents that feel unheard.\n\nI'm hoping my voice is the one voters choose to speak on and proudly share Pasco's future growth.",
