As mayor since 2014, I have committed to enhancing our public safety efforts to keep West Richland one of the safest and best places to raise a family. In partnership with the Richland School District, overcrowding at our schools was erased with the addition of a middle school and elementary school. Our community is known for its financial security, stability through balanced budgets, and strong financial practices including paying off over $1.2 million in infrastructure loans early. Under my leadership, we brought in $9.5 million in state and federal grants to enhance our city, while securing $26 million for the future widening of Van Giesen from the post office to Red Mountain Road. Economic development is coming to West Richland through community partnerships at the Belmont Business District, the Red Mountain Center, and through Van Giesen revitalization. Responsive and transparent government is the foundation of my administration and your comments and suggestions to shape our city have always been welcomed and appreciated.
