Elizabeth understands educational law, state standards, and the process in which educational policies and decisions are made. She is an advocate for curriculum and policies that respect individual student development and our diverse community.  \nElizabeth will take a stand against unfunded, mandated state testing. Her position comes from years of experience working at the local, state, and national level with assessment development and scoring. State testing doesn’t respect children's development, takes from educational time, and interferes with local decision making.  \nShe is a strong supporter of alternative learning environments. From home schooling to in-building schools and versions in between, Elizabeth believes that families should have options available to make the best educational decisions for their children and family.  \nElizabeth believes that there's a great deal our school boards can do to advocate for our children and our teachers, districts, and community can find common ground through common goals. Though our children have different educational needs, a student first, experienced school board is something they all deserve, and we should all work towards that together.",
