Since relocating to Kennewick 11+ years ago, I have hosted, taught, and tutored thousands of children in all areas of science and the arts. Providing effective instruction in multiple disciplines and encouraging cross-curriculum activities and discussions is important to creating well-rounded members of society.  \nAccessibility and transparency are keys to success; I believe giving everyone equitable access to both the actions and intents of the Board, as well as the tools needed to thrive and prosper in the classroom, is paramount to community and scholastic achievement. Preparing the next generation for an ever-evolving world means instilling a thirst for knowledge, honing critical-thinking skills, and teaching kindness and empathy.  \nI truly want what is best for our students, teachers, families, and the entirety of our wonderful community. Please vote Erin Steinert for School Board. Thank you.",
