Our city has faced unprecedented challenges in the last several years in response to the global pandemic. I am proud to have helped lead the effort advocating for our city and region to safely re-open our community as soon as possible.\n\nWe have achieved so much as a city the last four years, and our resiliency has never been more apparent. Richland is growing by leaps and bounds. As Mayor, I have been committed to reinvesting in our parks, roads, and public infrastructure. During my tenure on council we have completed construction of the Duportail Bridge, as well as a new city hall and fire stations. These investments will serve our community for generations to come.\n\nGoing forward, I am excited about the revitalization efforts we have undertaken through targeted downtown investments. I am committed to continuing to invest in our downtown and make it the jewel of our region.\n\nI’m asking for your vote to continue the progress we have made as a city the last four years.",
