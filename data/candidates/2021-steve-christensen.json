For the past 8 years I have served on the Pasco school board, working together with district leadership to determine the best educational vision and priorities for the success of our children. This past year has been especially challenging, but we are moving forward again. I am committed to taking the lessons we have learned from this experience and building on them to make our education system even better.  \n  \nI believe we need a strong public education system that serves all of our children â€“ one that will prepare them to make good decisions. Our students not only need education in reading, writing, math and science, but civics and social studies as well. This will require board members, district administration and the community working together to make sure our education system in Pasco is effective.\n\nI am asking for your support to return me to the board. It is my goal to continue to work on needed improvements while highlighting and building on the many good things that are happening in our school district.",
