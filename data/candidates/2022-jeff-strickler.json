  "statement": "**Elected Experience**  \nFirst-time candidate  \n  \n**Other Professional Experience**  \nRealtor serving residential and commercial needs in Eastern Washington and Oregon. Spent more than twenty years in the software industry, much of it running my own consulting practice.  \n  \n**Education**  \nLuther College, BA in Computer Science and Business Management.  \n  \n**Community Service**  \nAs a high school student, I spent many hours each week as a volunteer with our library board, as a reading tutor, and working with various non-profits. It’s time for me to give back to my community again as an elected official.   \n  \n**Statement**  \nThis campaign is about the future of our region. We need a strong voice in Olympia who shares the values of Eastern Washington and will work for us! I’ll prioritize economic development, the environment, and housing. We must work together to ensure that growing families can afford to put down roots here. We can create a more economically diverse and prosperous future for ourselves and following generations while maintaining the region’s character. I’m ready to work for you to secure our quality of life and ensure prosperity for all, including access to health care, child care, and education.",
