I have the leadership skills necessary to keep our community safe and lead the Prosecutor's Office into the future. With violent crime on the rise across our state, it's more important than ever to elect a leader with proven experience and positive relationships with our existing prosecutors. \n\nOver the past ten years, I have built strong relationships with our law enforcement, mayors, and community organizations.  I am prepared to leverage those relationships in support of additional resources for the Prosecutor's Office to maintain the quality of life we all enjoy.\n\nPlease join retired Benton County Sheriffs Larry Taylor and Steve Keane, Benton County Coroner Bill Leach, retired West Richland Police Chief Ben Majetich, and Benton County Prosecutor Andy Miller in supporting my campaign. I have spent my career defending the rights of our law enforcement officers. I would be honored if you would join these members of our law enforcement community in supporting my candidacy.",
