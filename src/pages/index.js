                Weâ€™ve collected links to regional questionnaires, interviews,
                forums, and written endorsements, plus donor data for all
                Washington State PDC candidates. (Weâ€™ll get FEC data next time
                around.) You can compare side by side or look at each candidate
                and see their donor details. You can drill all the way down to
                the candidateâ€™s PDC filing.

              <p>
                Our A/B questionnaire is based on top issues identified over
                recent years by the public and candidates themselves. Our
                process is imperfect, but itâ€™s intended to be nonpartisan and
                impartial while mirroring the messiness of being an elected
                official and a voter, where nearly all decisions are choices
                between two options you didnâ€™t come up with.{' '}

              <p>
                We painstakingly worked to encourage all candidates to
                participate. Our process is rigorous and some chose not to.

                We have done our best to speculate on the positions of
                candidates who did not answer to the best of our ability based
                on comments, traditional party positions, publicly available
                information, and input from engaged citizens.
